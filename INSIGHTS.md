# INSIGHTS — SQLite Analytics Challenge

1. The top 5 customers from Task 1 represent the highest lifetime revenue contributors. These customers should be considered for premium loyalty outreach or retention programs.

2. Category revenue (Task 2) reveals which product categories generate the largest share of revenue. Use this to prioritize marketing, inventory, and product development.

3. Comparing all-orders revenue to Delivered-only revenue (Task 2b) helps identify categories with high cancellation or return rates. Categories that drop in ranking may need operational review.

4. The employees earning above their department average (Task 3) may indicate senior contributors, possible pay compression issues, or areas needing compensation review.

5. Cities with the highest number of Gold customers (Task 4) can guide location-based promotions, faster shipping options, or targeted advertising.

6. Loyalty distributions by city (Task 4b) reveal where customer bases are mostly Bronze/Silver—good candidates for loyalty-level upgrade campaigns.

7. Cities with many Gold customers but low total customer counts may represent small but high-value markets worth special attention.

8. Always compare Delivered revenue to total revenue when estimating “real” financial performance to avoid overstating revenue due to canceled or incomplete orders.
